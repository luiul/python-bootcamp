# 2. Data Types

| Name           | Type  | Description                                                       |
| -------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Integers       | int   | Whole numbers, such as: 3 300 200                                 |
| Floating point | float | Numbers with decimal point: 2.3 4.6 100.0                         |
| Strings        | str   | Ordered sequence of characters: "hello" 'Sammy' "2000" "93 Cl‚Ñ¢    |
| Lists          | list  | Ordered sequence of objects: [10, "hello",200.3]                  |
| Dictionaries   | dict  | Unordered Key:Value pairs: ("mykey" :"value" ,"name" : "Frankie") |
| Tuples         | tup   | Ordered immutable sequence of objects: (10,"hello",200.3)         |
| Sets           | set   | Unordered collection of unique objects: ("a","b")                 |
| Booleans       | bool  | Logical value indicating True or False                            |

## 2.1. Numbers

There are two main number types we will work with:

- Integers which are whole numbers.
- Floating Point numbers which are numbers with a decimal.

Notes:

- [Issues and limitations of floating point arithmetic](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/floatingpoint.html).
- [Caret operator](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2451386/what-does-the-caret-operator-in-python-do)

## 2.2. Variable Assigments

Rules for variable names

- Names can not start with a number.
- There can be no spaces in the name, use `_` instead.
- Can't use any of these symbols `:",<>?\()!@#$%^&*~-+`
- It's considered best practice (PEP8) that names are lowercase.
- Avoid using words that have special meaning in Python like "list" and "str"

Python uses Dynamic Typing. This means you can reassign variables to different data types. This makes Python very flexible in assigning data types, this is different than other languages that are "Statically-Typed"

- Pros of Dynamic Typing:
  - Very easy to work with
  - Faster development time
- Cons of Dynamic Typing:
  - May result in bugs for unexpected data types!
  - You need to be aware of `type()`

## 2.3. Strings

Strings are sequences of characters, using the syntax of either single quotes or double quotes.Because strings are **ordered sequences** it means we can using **indexing** and **slicing** to grab sub-sections of the string.

### 2.3.1. Indexing

Indexing notation uses `[ ]` notation after the string (or variable assigned the string). Indexing allows you to grab a single character from the string. These actions use `[]` square brackets and a number index to indicate positions of what you wish to grab.

| Character:     | h   | e   | l   | l   | o   |
| -------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Index:         | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   |
| Reverse Index: | -5  | -4  | -3  | -2  | -1  |

### 2.3.2. Slicing

Slicing allows you to grab a subsection of multiple characters, a "slice" of the string. This has the following syntax:

```python
[start:stop:step]
```

- `start` is a numerical index for the slice start.
- `stop` is the index you will go up to (but not include).
- `step` is the size of the "jump" you take.

### 2.3.3. Immutability

String are immutable, i.e. Strings are not mutable! (meaning you can't use indexing to change individual elements of a string). String object does not support item assignment. Once a the characters in the strings are defined, you can not change them. If we want to reassign one of the characters, we have to do it with concatenation. Useful methods for strings:

```python
str.upper()
str.lower()
str.spilt()
```

[Pyformat](https://pyformat.info/).

## 2.4. Lists

Lists are ordered sequences that can hold a variety of object types. They use `[]` brackets and commas to separate objects in the list. Lists support indexing and slicing. Lists car be nested and also have a variety of useful methods that can be called off of them. Lists are mutable.

## 2.5. Dictionaries

Dictionaries are unordered mappings for storing objects. Previously we saw how lists store objects in an ordered sequence, dictionaries use a key-value pairing instead. This key-value pair allows users to quickly grab objects without needing to know an index location.

- Dictionaries: Objects retrieved by key name. Unordered and can not be sorted.
- Lists: Objects retrieved by location. Ordered Sequence can be indexed or sliced.

## 2.6. Tuples

Tuples are very similar to lists. However they have one key difference immutability. Once an element is inside a tuple, it can not be reassigned. Tuples use parenthesis: `(1,2,3)`.

## 2.7. Sets

Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. Meaning there can only be one representative of the same object.

## 2.8. Booleans

Booleans are operators that allow you to convey `True` or `False` statements. These are very important later on when we deal with **control flow** and **logic**.

## 2.9. I/O with Basic Files

Reading, Writing, Appending Modes:

- `mode='r'` is read only
- `mode='w'` is write only (will overwrite files or create new!)
- `mode='a'` is append only (will add on to files)
- `mode='r+'` is reading and writing
- `mode= 'w+'` is writing and reading (Overwrites existing files or creates new file!)

# 3. Python Statements

Let's begin to learn about **control flow** We often only want certain code to execute when a particular condition has been met (condition -> action).

## 3.1. If, Elif, Else Statements

To control this flow of logic we use some keywords:

- `if`
- `elif`
- `else`

Control Flow syntax makes use of colons and indentation (whitespace). This indentation system is crucial to Python and is what sets it apart from other programming languages.

## 3.2. For Loops (and Tuple Unpacking)

Many objects in Python are "iterable", i.e. we can iterate over every element in the object, e.g. every element in a list or every character in a string. We can use `for` loops to execute a block of code for every iteration.

The term iterable means you can "iterate" over the object, e.g. you can iterate over every character in a string, iterate over every item in a list, iterate over every key in a dictionary. Basic syntax:

```python
my_iterable = [1,2,3]
for item_name in my_iterable:
  do_something(item_name)
```

See notebook to read about tuple unpacking.

## 3.3. While Loop

While loops will continue to execute a block of code while some condition remains `True`. For example, while my pool is not full, keep filling my pool with water. You can combine with an `else` statement. Basic syntax:

```python
while bool_cond:
  # do something
else:
  # do something different
```

Important keywords in loops to add additional functionality for various cases:

- `break`: Breaks out of the current closest enclosing loop.
- `continue`: Goes to the top of the current closest enclosing loop.
- `pass`: does nothing at all.

## 3.4. Useful Operators

The operators are (see notebooks):

- `range(start, stop, step)`
- `enumerate(iterable)`: The enumerate object yields pairs containing a count (from start, which defaults to zero) and a value yielded by the iterable argument.
- `zip(*iterables)` --> A zip object yielding tuples until an input is exhausted.
- `in`: check if item is in iterable, e.g. `'x' in 'xyz' --> True`.
- `min(iterable)` and `max()` to find smallest and largest item in an iterable.

To import functions from a library we use the following syntax:

```python
from library import function
```

## 3.5. List Comprehension

List Comprehensions are a unique way of quickly creating a list with Python. If you find yourself using a `for` loop along with `.append()` to create a list, List Comprehensions are a good alternative! We flatten the `for` loop, e.g.:

```python
[x**2 for x in range(0,11) if x%2 == 0]
```

```python
[a for i in items if C]

```

```python
[a if C else b for i in items]

```

Makes a list of squared numbers from 0 to (excluding) 11, iff the number is even.

# 4. Methods and Functions

Creating clean repeatable code is a key part of becoming an effective programmer. **Functions** allow us to create blocks of code that can be easily executed many times, without needing to constantly rewrite the entire block of code. Tips to learn about functions in Python:

- Be patient with yourself.
- Take your time to practice the material.
- Start getting excited about your newskills and start thinking about personal projects.

## 4.1. def Keyword

Creating a function requires a very specific syntax, including the def keyword, correct indentation, and b proper structure. Basic syntax:

```python
# the convention is to use snake casing for functions
def print_hello():
  '''
  Docstring explains function
  '''
  # code to be executed when the function is called
  print('Hello!')
```

```python
def print_hello_w_name(name):
  '''
  Docstring explains function
  '''
  # code to be executed when the function is called
  print('Hello!' + name)
```

```python
def print_hello_w_name(name):
  '''
  Docstring explains function
  '''
  # code to be executed when the function is called
  print('Hello!' + name)
```

Typically we use the `return` keyword to send back the result of the function, instead of just printing it out. `return` allows us to assign the output of the function to a new variable.

```python
def add_numbers(num1,num2)
  '''
  Docstring explains function
  '''
  return num1 + num2
  # return allows to save the result to a variable
```

## 4.2. Basics of Python Functions

[Solution links](https://docs.google.com/document/d/181AMuP-V5VnSorl_q7p6BYd8mwXWBnsZY_sSPA8trfc/edit).

## 4.3. Lambda Expressions Map and Filter

We usually use lambda expression in conjunctions with the built-in `map` and `filter` functions. Use the `map` function if we compute something with the items of an iterable. Use the `filter` function if the function yields a boolean value baed on the item of the iterable.

## 4.4. Nested Statements and Scope: LEGB Rule

[Python scopes](https://realpython.com/python-scope-legb-rule/):

- L: Local ‚Äî Names assigned in any way within a function (def or lambda), and not declared global in that function.
- E: Enclosing function locals ‚Äî Names in the local scope of any and all enclosing functions (def or lambda), from inner to outer.
- G: Global (module) ‚Äî Names assigned at the top-level of a module file, or declared global in a def within the file.
- B: Built-in (Python) ‚Äî Names preassigned in the built-in names module : open, range, SyntaxError,...

# 5. Milestone Project 1

Preparation for the Milestone Project:

- Grab user input
- Manipulate a variable based on input
- Return back adjusted variable

Most programs that are interactive work on this very simple idea.

- Display something visual to the user
- Let the user update through an interaction
- Update variables in the program
- Display updated visual

Simple Interaction. We write a program that will:

- Display a list
- Have a user choose an index position and an input value
- Replace value at index position with user's chosen input value

Project scope. What needs to happen?

- We need to print a boar
- Take in player inpu
- Place their input on the boar
- Check if the game is won,tied, lost, or ongoin
- Repeat c and d until the game has been won or tie
- Ask if players want to play again.

# 6. Object Oriented Programming

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) allows programmers to create their own **objects** that have **methods** and **attributes**. Recall that after defining a string, list, dictionary, or other objects, you were able to call methods off of them with the `.method_name()` syntax.

These methods act as functions that use information about the object, as well as the object itself to return results, or change the current object.

In general, OOP allows us to create code that is **repeatable** and **organized**. Syntax:

```python
class NameOfClass(): 
  def __init__(self, param): 
    self.param = param

  def some_method(self): 
    print(self.param)
```

A class is a user defined object; it is a blueprint that defines the nature of a future object. An instance is a specific object created from a particular class.
