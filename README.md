# 2. Data Types

| Name           | Type  | Description                                                       |
| -------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Integers       | int   | Whole numbers, such as: 3 300 200                                 |
| Floating point | float | Numbers with decimal point: 2.3 4.6 100.0                         |
| Strings        | str   | Ordered sequence of characters: "hello" 'Sammy' "2000" "93 Cl‚Ñ¢    |
| Lists          | list  | Ordered sequence of objects: [10, "hello",200.3]                  |
| Dictionaries   | dict  | Unordered Key:Value pairs: ("mykey" :"value" ,"name" : "Frankie") |
| Tuples         | tup   | Ordered immutable sequence of objects: (10,"hello",200.3)         |
| Sets           | set   | Unordered collection of unique objects: ("a","b")                 |
| Booleans       | bool  | Logical value indicating True or False                            |

## 2.1. Numbers

There are two main number types we will work with:

- Integers which are whole numbers.
- Floating Point numbers which are numbers with a decimal.

Notes:

- [Issues and limitations of floating point arithmetic](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/floatingpoint.html).
- [Caret operator](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2451386/what-does-the-caret-operator-in-python-do)

## 2.2. Variable Assigments

Rules for variable names

- Names can not start with a number.
- There can be no spaces in the name, use `_` instead.
- Can't use any of these symbols `:",<>?\()!@#$%^&*~-+`
- It's considered best practice (PEP8) that names are lowercase.
- Avoid using words that have special meaning in Python like "list" and "str"

Python uses Dynamic Typing. This means you can reassign variables to different data types. This makes Python very flexible in assigning data types, this is different than other languages that are "Statically-Typed"

- Pros of Dynamic Typing:
  - Very easy to work with
  - Faster development time
- Cons of Dynamic Typing:
  - May result in bugs for unexpected data types!
  - You need to be aware of `type()`

## 2.3. Strings

Strings are sequences of characters, using the syntax of either single quotes or double quotes.Because strings are **ordered sequences** it means we can using **indexing** and **slicing** to grab sub-sections of the string.

### 2.3.1. Indexing

Indexing notation uses `[ ]` notation after the string (or variable assigned the string). Indexing allows you to grab a single character from the string. These actions use `[]` square brackets and a number index to indicate positions of what you wish to grab.

| Character:     | h   | e   | l   | l   | o   |
| -------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Index:         | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   |
| Reverse Index: | -5  | -4  | -3  | -2  | -1  |

### 2.3.2. Slicing

Slicing allows you to grab a subsection of multiple characters, a "slice" of the string. This has the following syntax:

```python
[start:stop:step]
```

- `start` is a numerical index for the slice start.
- `stop` is the index you will go up to (but not include).
- `step` is the size of the "jump" you take.

### 2.3.3. Immutability

String are immutable, i.e. Strings are not mutable! (meaning you can't use indexing to change individual elements of a string). String object does not support item assignment. Once a the characters in the strings are defined, you can not change them. If we want to reassign one of the characters, we have to do it with concatenation. Useful methods for strings:

```python
str.upper()
str.lower()
str.spilt()
```

[Pyformat](https://pyformat.info/).

## 2.4. Lists

Lists are ordered sequences that can hold a variety of object types. They use `[]` brackets and commas to separate objects in the list. Lists support indexing and slicing. Lists car be nested and also have a variety of useful methods that can be called off of them. Lists are mutable.

## 2.5. Dictionaries

Dictionaries are unordered mappings for storing objects. Previously we saw how lists store objects in an ordered sequence, dictionaries use a key-value pairing instead. This key-value pair allows users to quickly grab objects without needing to know an index location.

- Dictionaries: Objects retrieved by key name. Unordered and can not be sorted.
- Lists: Objects retrieved by location. Ordered Sequence can be indexed or sliced.

## 2.6. Tuples

Tuples are very similar to lists. However they have one key difference immutability. Once an element is inside a tuple, it can not be reassigned. Tuples use parenthesis: `(1,2,3)`.

## 2.7. Sets

Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. Meaning there can only be one representative of the same object.

## 2.8. Booleans

Booleans are operators that allow you to convey `True` or `False` statements. These are very important later on when we deal with **control flow** and **logic**.

## 2.9. I/O with Basic Files

Reading, Writing, Appending Modes:
- `mode='r'` is read only
- `mode='w'` is write only (will overwrite files or create new!)
- `mode='a'` is append only (will add on to files)
- `mode='r+'` is reading and writing
- `mode= 'w+'` is writing and reading (Overwrites existing files or creates new file!)

# Python Statements

Let's begin to learn about **control flow** We often only want certain code to execute when a particular condition has been met (condition -> action).

## If, Elif, Else Statements

To control this flow of logic we use some keywords:

- `if`
- `elif`
- `else`

Control Flow syntax makes use of colons and indentation (whitespace). This indentation system is crucial to Python and is what sets it apart from other programming languages.

## For Loops (and Tuple Unpacking)

Many objects in Python are "iterable", i.e. we can iterate over every element in the object, e.g. every element in a list or every character in a string. We can use `for` loops to execute a block of code for every iteration.

The term iterable means you can "iterate" over the object, e.g. you can iterate over every character in a string, iterate over every item in a list, iterate over every key in a dictionary. Basic syntax:

```python
my_iterable = [1,2,3]
for item_name in my_iterable:
  do_something(item_name)
```

See notebook to read about tuple unpacking.

## WHile Loop

While loops will continue to execute a block of code while some condition remains `True`. For example, while my pool is not full, keep filling my pool with water. Basic syntax:

```python
while bool_cond:
  # do something
```
